              <h4>Back Story</h4>
              <p>
                I grew up in Kansas City and went to the University of Missouri
                for college. After college, I left Kansas City for the East
                Coast. I landed in Philadelphia where I worked in the investment
                accounting industry. After 7+ years in the investment accounting
                industry and a run at entrepreneurship, has led me to become an
                aspiring software developer. Never found any passion in
                accounting as I have with coding. I love problem solving and
                coding has given me the chance to utilize those skills. As I
                continue to learn, my goal is to land a full time web developer
                job by end of 2020.
              </p>

              <h4>My Passions</h4>
              <p>
                I absolutely love sports. I grew up playing and watching football, basketball, baseball, bowling and golf. To this day, I still enjoying watching them all but unforunately don't have the time to actually play most of them. I have recently gotten back into bowling though and joined a league this past fall. It's a sport that once you can constitent enough that it becomes very addicting to play. I have a few ideas how technology could help the sport and would love to be able to code those out someday.
